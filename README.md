# bombino remote

Target repo for storing all universal/utility scripts within [bombino generated Adobe panels](https://github.com/Inventsable/bombino), [inspired by RemoteControl panel](https://github.com/Inventsable/RemoteControl). All bombino templates will be reconfigured to draw their JSX scripts from "cloud" rather than local storage, so all updates to this repo will instantly take effect in future panels with no need to reinstall via npm.
